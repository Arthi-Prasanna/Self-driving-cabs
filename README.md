This project builds a Reinforcement Learning–based self-driving cab that learns to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and follow lanes through trial-and-error interactions with a simulated environment. Using Q-Learning or Deep Q-Networks, the agent observes its state, takes actions, and improves its driving behaviour through a reward-based system without requiring labeled training data. The project demonstrates core RL concepts such as exploration–exploitation, policy optimization, and reward shaping, ultimately showcasing how autonomous vehicles can learn intelligent driving strategies purely from experience.
